# Scene
Scene and Input 
In this project I created a 2D and a 3D scene. The 3D scene is just a world with a skybox and several mesh objects with terrain.
In the 2D scene I created a tilset 3 tiles and my sprite is a cube that has user input that can jump up and down with (W,A,S,D) and 
(space) witht VS code called PlayerAction and Player Controls. I also added 2 other sprites and implemented a mouse tracker so when
you click on a space in the 2D game, the object will follow where you clicked last and the code can be found in stalkerMovement.
